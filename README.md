# Arduino Radar for Object Detection 🚀

This project implements a low-cost radar system using an Arduino UNO, ultrasonic sensor, and servo motor. The system scans a 180° area, detects objects, and visualizes them in real time using the Processing IDE.

## 📌 Features
- Real-time object detection and distance tracking
- Servo motor-based radar sweep
- 180° scanning arc with obstacle mapping
- Visualization of radar sweep on PC using Processing

## 🧰 Components Used
- Arduino UNO  
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- SG90 Servo Motor  
- USB Cable  
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires  
- Processing IDE (for PC visualization)

## 🛠️ How to Use

### 1. Hardware Setup
- Connect the ultrasonic sensor and servo motor to the Arduino UNO as per the circuit diagram.
- Mount the ultrasonic sensor on the servo for dynamic angle rotation.

### 2. Upload Code to Arduino
- Open `radar.ino` from the `Arduino_Code/` folder.
- Upload it to your Arduino UNO using the Arduino IDE.
